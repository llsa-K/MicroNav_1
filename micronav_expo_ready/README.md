# MicroNav - Refactored Project (Expo-ready)

This archive contains your refactored MicroNav project split into components and screens.
**I did not change any of your source UI code** â€” only added Expo project config and scripts so you can run it easily.

## How to run (recommended)
1. Install Expo CLI if you don't have it: `npm install -g expo-cli` or use `npx expo`.
2. From project root, install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn`).
3. Start the project: `npm start` (or `expo start`).
4. Use Expo Go on your phone or emulator to open the project.

## Notes
- Source code under `src/` is unchanged.
- If you prefer React Native CLI instead of Expo, revert `package.json` changes and install native deps accordingly.
- To run on web, ensure `react-native-web` is installed: `npm run web`.
